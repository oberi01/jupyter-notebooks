### Purpose
This project holds a selection of jupyter notebooks 
that might be helpful when working with pandas.
The .ipynb files are rendered on github, so a
notebook can be viewed without an installed jupyter
environment.

### Why are there .py files
Since .ipynb files change with each execution of a notebook, 
tracking changes is not really possible. Fortunately the jupytext project 
provides a .py representation of a notebook which can be kept in git.
