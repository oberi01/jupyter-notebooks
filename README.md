### Purpose
This project holds a selection of jupyter notebooks 
that might be helpful when working with pandas

### Why are there .py files
Since ipynb files change with each execution of a notebook, 
keeping them in git is not advisable. Fortunately the jupytext project 
provides a .py representation of a notebook which can be kept in git.
